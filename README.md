The aim of this project is to assess the degree to which metastasis of NSCLC can be accurately predicted using genomic data from TRACERx
and elucidate the factors that confer metasatic potential in cancer evolution.

This repository contains the code used to process and analyse data from the TRACERx 421 cohort using machine learning models, as well as 
the prediction results, performance metrics, and plots. 

The open source TRACERx data can be found here: https://github.com/McGranahanLab/LCCE_workshop_2023/wiki.
